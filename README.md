# Dotenv for Zsh

zsh-dotenv automatically sources `.env` file when enter directories and `.unenv` file when leave directories (not for leaving for sub-directories)

This plugin is adapted from oh-my-zsh's dotenv plugin but with automatically sourcing `.unenv` file when leave the directory tree.

## Releated projects
- [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
- [zsh-autoenv](https://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-autoenv)

And their releated projcets.

I don't use their rich features. And Those projects is **a little** laggy in my zsh configurations.

So I decided to use my own.
